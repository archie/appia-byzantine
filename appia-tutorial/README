(3) COMPILE AND RUN
__________________________________________________________________________

To compile the sources, you can use Apache Ant or a Java editor.
This distribution includes an example application that initializes each
protocol stack and includes a simple command line shell to send/receive
messages using the configured protocols.
This application can be started using the run.sh script.
On a linux shell, just run ./run.sh to see the usage options.
When the application is started, just type "help" to see the available
commands.
